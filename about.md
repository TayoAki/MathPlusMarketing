At Math + Marketing we design digital marketing strategies to help local businesses consistently deliver relevant media to consumers. We believe every advertisement should be a personalized experience with curated content that your customers will actually enjoy. Successful digital marketing is a slow and steady process that requires a scientific approach. It takes the right data coupled with the right algorithm to place the perfect ad in front of the right person. Contrary to popular belief, you should always pay *careful* attention to *"the man behind the curtain."* 

**We at Math + Marketing are quantitative experts who understand just how math focused digital advertising really is.**
